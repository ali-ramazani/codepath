Submitted by: **Ali Ramazani**

This web app: **A weather dashboard application that fetches real-time weather data from a public API. Users can view current weather conditions based on their location, view weather conditions in 20 major cities across the globe, and search for weather information by city, and apply various filters to customize the displayed data.**

Time spent: **3** hours spent in total

## Notes

One challenge I faced was with debugging as the API was rate-limited and I had to wait for a while to test my code. Moreover, I had to use a proxy server to bypass CORS issues.
